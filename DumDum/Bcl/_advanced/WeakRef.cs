		/// <para>when you create a short weak reference, a few things happen.  First, a new object (the WeakReference) class is constructed with your object.  The WeakReference instance internally stores an IntPtr to a GCHandle which is allocated with GCHandleType.Weak (or WeakTrackRessurection for long weak references).  The WeakReference then drops the strong handle to your object.
		/// 
		/// This is where the magic happens…
		/// 
		/// The CLR takes this GCHandle, and maintains an internal table of weak references.  This is a separately maintained list of handles in the runtime.  When a garbage collection happens, the GC builds a full graph of the objects rooted within your application.  Prior to doing any cleanup, the weak reference table is scanned, and any references found which point to an object outside of the GC graph are marked as null.  However, your WeakReference instance still points to this same location in the WeakReference table.</para>
